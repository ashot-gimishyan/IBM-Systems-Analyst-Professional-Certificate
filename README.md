# IBM Systems Analyst Professional Certificate

This repository documents my progress through the IBM Systems Analyst Professional Certificate on Coursera. The program, developed by IBM, covers essential skills for systems analysts, including business process modeling, requirements gathering, data visualization with Excel and Cognos, IT systems design, software testing, and the application of generative AI in analysis. Through hands-on projects and a capstone, Iâ€™ve gained practical experience in evaluating, designing, and improving business and IT systems to drive effective organizational solutions.
